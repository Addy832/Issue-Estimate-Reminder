Issue Estimate Reminder

This repository contains the code for the GitHub App "Issue Estimate Reminder". The app automatically detects when a new GitHub issue is created and writes a comment to remind the issue creator to provide a time estimate if itâ€™s missing. This functionality helps the team scope and schedule projects more effectively.

Features

Automatic Issue Detection: Listens for new issue events.
Estimate Reminder: Comments on issues without an estimate in the format "Estimate: X days".
